          You might know of the hippo already. Weather it be Gloria or
          Moto-Moto from the movies Madegascar 1 and 2, the zoo, or just from
          various media depictions of the African Safari. But how much do you
          truely know about the hippo?

        <h3 title="SERIOUSLY!" style="color:red;"> DANGER! </h3>
        <b> HIPPOS ARE AMONG THE MOST DANGEROUS ANIMALS ALIVE! </b> <br>
        <p>
          Despite usually eating plants, hippos can and do occasionally eat
          meat. They demonstrate incredably violent tendencies, brutally mauling
          any predators stupid enough to challenge them, and killing several
          hundred people per year. Given what hippos are capable of, some of
          those killings were probably achieved by bitting off the poor soul's
          head. Yeah, you read that right.
        </p>
        <em>
          Hippos can pop a person's head like a pimple with a single bite.
        </em>
        <p>
          So, for your next African Safari, maybe don't go anywhere near the
          water.

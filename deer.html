          The Cervvidae family, commonly refered to as deer, are surprisingly
          good at getting people, and often themselves, killed. Although their
          legaly determined responsibility depends on local traffic laws, car
          accidents involving them are recorded as killing hundreds every year.

          That makes them genuienly more likely to kill you than a shark.

          To be fair, it is never intentional, and depending on which kind of
          deer it is, it may also die in or due to the crash. This just adds to
          the fact that humans are one of their top predators, given how many
          species of deer are hunted for sport. If you really wanted to, one
          could consider the deaths attributed to deer as the tax for hunting
          them. Although, that would mean the deer are intentionaly jumping in
          the way of cars. . .

        <p> Nah, that's ridiculous. </p>
